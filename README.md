# engineer-hiring-tech-exercise

Create a Python app that can be run from the command line that will accept a base URL and then crawler the entire site.
For each page it finds, the script will print the URL of the page and all the links it finds on that page.
The crawler will only process that one domain and not crawl links to other domains or even subdomains.
Please employ patterns that will allow your crawler to run as quickly as possible.
Do not use tools like scrapy or Playwright. You may use libraries to parse the HTML.
This exercise is intended to allow you to demonstrate how you design software and write good quality code. We will look at how you have structured your code and test cases.
Include a README that will discuss some of the tradeoffs that you have made, things that you might have addressed if time constraints allowed.
