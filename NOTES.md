- Initial study of the brief. Seems fairly straightforward but certain there will be some complexities around asyncio which the README is hinting at.
- Setup repo with some basics. 
    - Using Poetry for dependency management.
    - Ruff for formating and linting.
    - Trying out Pyre for typechecking.
    - Pytest and Pytest-BDD for testing frameworks. Will likely need pytest-asycio at some point.
    - Using invoke as a task runner

- Initial test
    - Add initial feature file by asking Gemini to generate a feature file based on the "The test" section of the README
    - Generate a test that runs but is red. Will build up the initial test using the happy path.
